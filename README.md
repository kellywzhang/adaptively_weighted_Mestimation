# Statistical Inference with M-Estimators on Adaptively Collected Data

- To reproduce multi-arm bandit experiments use `run_mab.sh' script.
- To reproduce contextual bandit experiments use `run_context.sh' script.

## Overview of Files

- `mab_simulations.py`: Code to run multi-arm bandit simulations
- `process_mab.py`: Code to process mab-simulations and perform inference
- `run_mab.sh`: Bash script to reproduce multiarm bandit experiments

### Contextual Bandit Code
- `context_simulations.py`: Code to run contextual bandit simulations
- `process_context.py`: Code to process contextual bandit simulations and perform inference
- `optimize.py`: Bash script to reproduce contextual bandit experiments
- `run_context.sh`: Bash script to reproduce contextual bandit experiments
